# Neural Networks for Real-time Audio Distortion Reduction

This repository contains the training, generation, and analysis scripts from the bachelor's thesis of Lūkass Žube:

**"Research on the application of neural networks for real-time reduction of distortion in audio signals"**

## Repository Structure

- **Analysis**: Scripts for analyzing RERR and RMSE of different trained models, as well as MTND and SNLD analysis.
- **TDNN**: Training files that automatically generate checkpoint and model directories.
- **Test Signal Scripts**: MATLAB files for signal generation.
- **Utility Scripts**: Scripts for scaling, aligning, and displaying information for WAV files.
